I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science with focus on machine learning at the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en), [University of Tartu](http://ut.ee/). My PhD is supervised by Meelis Kull from [Machine Learning Research Group](http://ml.cs.ut.ee/). My major research focus is on **deep learning** and I am particularly interested about **uncertainty estimation** and novel **learning schemes**, think of Generative Models ;)

I have applied deep learning in **time-series forecasting**, and limited use cases of image and sound data. The other areas of AI/ML that catch my interest are reinforcement learning and Bayesian methods. Idea of General Artificial Intelligence excites me and seems like a nice vision to have. For now though I am more determined to work on aspects of machine learning that could immediately be more of practical use. To this end, my current efforts are with implications/applicability in the energy sector (**renewable energies** in particular) and (perhaps) various applications of deep learning in automation as (predictive/forecasting systems).

In this website you can find projects that I have been involved with (more industrial projects yet to come in following yearas but for now mostly course projects).I am also about to write blog posts which may contain contents ranging from my research work to hobbies and other interests.

- [To my blog posts](https://novinsh.github.io/blog/)
- [To my portfolio](https://novinsh.github.io/portfolio/)

Speaking of hobbies, I would like to spend my free time and sometimes more than that (:D) on followings:
- Acoustic Guitar
- Photography
